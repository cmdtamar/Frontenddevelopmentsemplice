# Frontenddevelopmentsemplice
For my study Communication and Multimedia Design (subject: Frontend Development) I made 2 pages from a website with correct html, css and js. I decided to remake the website Semplice and the pages Homepage and Showcase. With my little experience with coding, for now, I made something I am very proud off.

This is the website:
https://cmdtamar.github.io/Frontenddevelopmentsemplice/

The main focus with this project was responsiveness. To make the website work on different screens and adjust the details.
